FOUR INTERESTING MATERIALS FOR LATE 2024


28 August 2024 â€“ The following materials, still at an early or mid technological readiness level, can be prepared and tested in-house for preliminary R&D work or dissemination purposes, employing a metallurgy lab (5kN universal testing machine with small punch test modding + small tube furnace + modified 3D printer for injection molding + standard lab equipment) worth as little as 5k euros:

-	Fe-18Cr-8Ni-2Mn-1Cu-0.1N (austenitic stainless steel): automotive applications;

-	Fe20Cr20Ni20Mn20Co20 (high entropy alloy): similar to austenitic steel, space applications;

-	70% PLA + 20% PHB + 10% limonene as plasticizer (bioplastic): packaging applications;

-	PLA with 2% graphene nanoplatelet (conductive polymer): electronics applications.


There are no non-standard risks associated, so any qualified operator should be able to process the materials and execute the tests by following checklists for safety and for the reliability of results.
